    <h2>1) Can you "return" an animal to the shelter? </h2>
    <p>We understand that there may be issues arising from adoption such as allergies, monetary reasons, private reasons, etc.</p>
    <p>We allow individuals to bring back any pets they adopted at any time, for any reason.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>2) What happens if the animal I adopt is sick? </h2>
    <p>We understand at times that animals can come down with kennel cough/ or other illnesses.</p>
    <p>If an animal is adopted and is sick we will provide the necessary medication and try to cover as much cost of the petcare as possible. </p>
    <br>
    <h2>3)Where can I take my new furry friend for health checks up?</h2>
    <p>Our main goal is to have our animals be sent to loving homes...</p>
    <p>As such we do not provide checkups or non emergency care; we will reccomend several local pet clinics near you.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>4) Are your animals microchipped? </h2>
    <p>Some of the best and safest practices to ensure the saftey of our pets is to microchip them...</p>
    <p>As such, we microchip every single pet before we send them off to loving homes!</p>
    <br>
    <h2>5) What do you do to the animals that stay here for long?</h2>
