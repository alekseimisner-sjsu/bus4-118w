          <p>What To Do If Your Pet Is Lost</p>
          <p>If you have lost your pet, please call your local animal shelter or animal control agency. Put up posters and
            signs where your animal was last seen in populated areas such as schools and grocery stores. The posters should 
            include a description and a picture of what your pet looks like. Talk to people within the area where your pet 
            was last seen to see if you can find any clues or leads. You should visit any animal shelters within the area your
            pet was last seen and look at impounded animals.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Found Animals</h2>
            <p>What To Do If You Found a Lost Pet</p>
            <p>If you have found a lost pet, take it to your local animal shelter so that it may return to their original owners.
              If you are interested in keeping the animal, you should still take it to your local animal shelter for the holding
              period and fill out an application for the animal. If the discovered animal is not taken to a shelter, 
              then the pet will not be reunited with their owner and may not be able to become adopted.</p>

               <h2>Steps You Can Take To Keep Your Pet Safe</h2>
               <ul>
                <li>Don't leave your pet unsupervised. You should never leave your pet by themselves for
                   extended periods of time. Most of the time, when pets are left by themselves they tend 
                   to get bored and find a way to escape their environment. If you are unable to supervise your
                   pet, it is best to hire a pet sitter or place them in a pet darecare center until you return. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Have your pet microchiped. Microchips are tiny implants that are planted between your pet's 
                  shoulder blades. This implant contains vital information that can identify your pet when they
                  are found and taken to a shelter or a veterinarian. Many lost pets are recovered this way and it
                  is simple since all that is needed is to scan the implant.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>You should spray or neuter your pet. Accoridng to recent data, 75% of pets that are owned are 
                  sprayed or neutered while 10% of animals brought to shelters are sprayed or neutered. Pets that
                  are sprayed or neutered will not wander off to find a mate.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Make sure that your pet is placed in a secured fence or leash. Most pets that are lost is due to 
                  not having them placed in a secured yard so they go wandering off unsupervised. Fences should be tall
                  enough to stop your pet from jumping over them and shhould be buried at least 6 inches into the grouund to
                  stop your pets from digging out under the fence. When you are out with your pet, use a leash to keep them
                  safe and supervised.  
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Train your pet. This is recommended mostly for dogs since obedient dogs are have a low chance
                  of ending up in animal shelters. Training classes for pets can provide valuable information for 
                  owners on how to keep their pets safe while also making pets obedient to their owners command. This 
                  will reduce the chances of pets running off as well as improving realtionships between pets and their
                  owners.
